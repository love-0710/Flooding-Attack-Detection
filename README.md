# Flooding-Attack-Detection
The aim of this project is to develop a system for detecting flooding attacks, which are a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that overwhelm a network with excessive traffic. By employing various machine learning techniques, this project will identify and mitigate the impact of flooding attacks on network performance.
